How to apply for a job
The first thing you need to do is create a complete resume. To work in one of the Gong Cha systems in Australia, you have two ways to apply:

1. Apply online

This approach offers the benefit of submitting your application directly through Gong Cha's human resources portal. Upon review, they will arrange for observations and potentially schedule an interview at one of their branches facing staffing shortages. However, a drawback could be the distance of the branch from your residence.

2. Apply at the place you want to work
By choosing to apply directly to the desired Gong Cha location, you bypass the human resources department's review process, ensuring that your CV goes directly to the store manager or Area Manager. This direct approach allows you to select a store conveniently located near you. However, if the chosen store isn't currently hiring, there's a likelihood that your CV might go unnoticed.

What do Gong Cha employees need to do?
They will provide you with recipe books, which is what you are required to memorize and execute smoothly when you start working here. It includes:

Kitchen section: cooking tea, cooking topping
Ordering: taking customer order and scooping topping
Blending: blending some unnormal milk tea
Shaking: mixing tea or milk tea with ice and syrup

Wishing you a successful application!
